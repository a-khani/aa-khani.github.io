### I'm Ali, a motivated sophomore student at the University of California, Berkeley double-majoring in Computer Science & Data Science.

My favorite programming language is Python.

↳ I use libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, & TensorFlow. 

↳ I'm highly proficient in Java, C, C++, and SQL.

↳ I have experience with the MERN stack, HTML/CSS, R, and JSON.



During my time at Berkeley, I've become experienced in Git and Googling, which I've utilized to help me on projects in software engineering, data science, and cryptography. 



So far I've built:

↳ a generalized simulator emulating the historic WWII Enigma encryption machine,

↳ a 93%-accurate Python spam email classifier,

↳ a version-control system in Java supporting nearly 20 Git commands,

and various other projects!

I'm also passionate about tennis, lightsaber dueling, teaching, and going on roadtrips across California.
